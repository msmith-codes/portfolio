                    <h2>What game development projects should I do?</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            2D Platformer
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Create a 2D platformer with: levels, enemies, and collectibles.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Focus on character movement, collision detection and level design.</li>
                                        <li>Do not focus on graphics. Use an asset pack or simple shapes.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Focus on enemies with basic AI, weapon switching, and a scoring system.</li>

                    <h2>What game engine do you recommend?</h2>
                    <p>
                        My person choice for indie game developers who are not interested in engine development 
                        would be the <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How would I get started making a game engine?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Personally, if your goal is to make a game, then use an engine. There is no sense in reinventing the wheel
                        if you objective is to make a game. However, if your goal is to deeply understand how games function then I 
                        would first check out <a href="https://www.raylib.com/" target="_blank">RayLib</a> and write a C++ framework using it. This
                        is a good introduction into making games without an editor. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you have completed that, then you can write the
                        RayLib functions yourself. This would involve doing graphics programming with <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank">OpenGL</a>, 
                        creating a window with <a href="https://www.glfw.org/" target="_blank">GLFW</a>, and creating or linking a physics engine into the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only begin creating a game engine once you have created a game in a pre-existing engine, like <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>To-Do List Application:</strong> Create a simple terminal app that allows useres to add, edit, and delete tasks.
                            Make sure you store tasks in a local database or file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Calculator:</strong> Create a simple terminal calculator that reads in input from the standard input stream and have
                            it compute the result.
                        </li>
