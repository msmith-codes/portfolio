            <h2>// Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Improving at coding is a never ending journey. There is always something to learn and explore.
                However, for beginner and intermediate developers, it can be hard to know where to start. Personally,
                I wanted to improve my coding skills so I could build better projects and work on more interesting problems.
                In this article, we will explore some tips and tricks to help you improve at coding. These tips will apply to
                many different kinds of developers. Whether you are a web developer, game developer, or data scientist, these tips 
                will help you improve your coding skills.

            <h2>// Problem Solving</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most important skills for a developer is problem solving. Being able to break down a problem
                into smaller, more manageable pieces is essential for writing good code. One way to improve your problem
                solving skills is to practice solving coding challenges. Websites like <Link target="_blank" href={"https://leetcode.com/"}>LeetCode</Link>, <Link target="_blank" href="https://www.codewars.com/">CodeWars</Link>, and <Link target="_blank" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</Link> offer 
                a wide variety of coding challenges to help you improve your problem solving skills. Improving 
                your <strong>algorithmic thinking</strong> is a great way to improve your coding skills. What is algorithmic thinking?
                It is the ability to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces. <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>Challenge:</strong> Try to develop a system to organize a library's inventory.
            </p>
            <h2>// Building Projects</h2>
            <p>
                In my opinion, the best way to improve at coding is to build projects. These projects
                can be anything from a simple to-do list to a full-fledged game engine. The key is to build something
                that challenges you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting with small projects and working your way up to larger projects is a great way to improve your
                coding skills. Small projects will help you learn the basics of a language or framework, while larger
                projects will help you apply what you have learned and deepen your understanding of how things work.
            </p>

            </ul>
            <h2>// Reading Code</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding how other developers write code is a great way to improve your own coding skills. 
                You can do this by exploring open source projects on <Link target="_blank" href="https://github.com">GitHub</Link> or by reading articles and tutorials. 
                Try pairing up with a more experienced developer and ask them to review your code. This will help
                you learn new techniques and best practices.
            </p>

            </ul>
            <h2>// Explore New Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                Technology is always changing and evolving. As a developer, it is important to stay up to date with the latest
                trends and technologies. One way to do this is to explore new technologies and learn how they work.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can do this by learning a new programming language, framework, or library. 
                You could also dive into the realm of Docker, Git, CI/CD pipelines and more. 
                Try to build a project using the new technology to solidify your understanding. 
                Building existing technologies from the ground up is a great way to learn how things 
                work. <Link target="_blank" href={"https://build-your-own-x.vercel.app/"}>Build your own X</Link> is 
                a great resource for this.
            </p>
            <h2>// Practice Debugging</h2>
            <p>
                Debugging is an essential skill for any developer. Being able to find and fix bugs in your code is
                crucial for writing good code. One way to improve your debugging skills is to practice debugging
                on a regular basis. Try to find and fix bugs in your code, or ask a friend to help you debug their code.
            </p>
            <h2>// Staying Consistent and Avoid Burnout</h2>
            <p>
                Improving at coding takes time and effort. It is important to stay consistent and avoid burnout. 
                Set aside time each day to work on coding projects or practice coding challenges. Take breaks when 
                you need them and make sure to get plenty of rest. Remember, improving at coding is a journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Remember:</strong> It is okay to take breaks and step away from your computer. 
                Sometimes, taking a break can help you come back to a problem with a fresh perspective.
            </p>
            <h2>// Soft Skills Matter Too</h2>
            <p>
                Soft skills are just as important as technical skills. Soft skills are the skills that help you work 
                well with others and communicate effectively. Some important soft skills for developers include 
                teamwork, communication, problem solving, organization, and time management.
            </p>
            <p>
                One way to improve your soft skills is to work on projects with other developers. This will help you 
                learn how to collaborate effectively and communicate with others. This will allow you to practice patience and
                open-mindedness. You can also take online courses or workshops to improve your soft skills.
            </p>
            <h2>// Document Your Work</h2>
            <p>
                Documenting your work is an essential skill for any developer. Writing clear and concise documentation 
                will help others understand your code and how it works. It will also help you remember how your code works 
                in the future. Writing files such as README.md, LICENSE, and CONTRIBUTING.md are great ways to document your work.
            </p>
            <h2>// Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Improving at coding is a journey that takes time and effort. By practicing problem solving, building projects, 
                reading code, exploring new technologies, practicing debugging, and improving your soft skills, you can become 
                a better developer. Remember to stay consistent, take breaks when you need them, and enjoy the process of learning 
                and growing as a developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Remember:</strong> Everyone starts somewhere. Don't be discouraged if you don't see progress right away. 
                Keep practicing and learning, and you will improve over time.
