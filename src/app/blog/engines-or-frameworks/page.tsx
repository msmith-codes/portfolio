            <h2>// Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Game engines and game frameworks are tools that assist game developers in creating games.
                Typically, they provide tools for rendering graphics, playing audio, and handling input. 
                But what is the difference between a game engine and a game framework and which one should you use?
            </p>

            <h2>// Game Engines</h2>
            <p>
                Lets start with game engines. Game engines are software that provide a suite of tools for game developers.
                These tools can include rendering graphics, playing audio, handling input, and physics simulations. 
                Game engines are typically more complex than game frameworks and are often used for larger projects. 
                They can also be more expensive and have a steeper learning curve. Some popular game engines include Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Game engines are great for developers who want to create complex games with advanced features. 
                They provide a lot of functionality out of the box and can save developers a lot of time. 
                However, they can be overkill for smaller projects and may be more difficult to learn. 
                Game engines will come with a level editor, a scripting language, and a physics engine which will allow you to create a game without having to write a lot of code.
                This can be a huge time saver and can allow you to focus on the game design rather than the technical details. 
            </p>

            <h2>// Game Frameworks</h2>
            <p>
                Game frameworks are similar to game engines but are typically less complex. 
                They provide a set of tools for game developers but are more lightweight and flexible. 
                Game frameworks are often used for smaller projects or for developers who want more control over their code. 
                Some popular game frameworks include RayLib (C), Phaser (JavaScript), and Pygame (Python).
            </p>
            <p>
                Game frameworks are great for developers who want to have more control over their code and who want to learn more about how games work.
                Unlike game engines, game frameworks do not come with a level editor or a physics engine. Therefore, you will have to write more code to create a game.
                This can be a good thing if you want to learn more about game development or if you want to create a game with a unique look or feel.
            </p>

            <h2>// Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                So which one should you use? It depends on your goals and your experience level. 
                If you are new to game development and want to create a game quickly, a game engine might be the best choice. 
                If you are more experienced and want more control over your code, a game framework might be the way to go. 
                Ultimately, both game engines and game frameworks are powerful tools that can help you create amazing games. 
                The best tool for you will depend on your goals and your experience level.
